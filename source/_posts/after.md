<p class="center">Like a sweet melody
Memories of your love still linger on inside of me
A recurring dream
Visions of you return night after night so hauntingly
I lay awake 'til four or five without you by my side

I never knew how much you were a part of me
I was a fool, so unaware yet now I see
So many words I never took the time to say
I guess you don't know what you've got
Until you've gone and let it slip away

After we said goodbye
Baby I finally realized
That I just cannot walk away
'Cause this love for you still remains in my heart

And you come to me
Every time I close my eyes
You're all that I can see
I am never free
Even when I'm asleep I feel your presence here with me
I try so hard to just hold on
When I wake you're gone

I never knew how much you were a part of me
I was a fool so unaware but now I see
So many words I never took the time to say
I guess you don't know what you've got
Until you've gone and let it slip away

After we said goodbye
Baby I finally realized
That I just cannot walk away
'Cause this love for you still remains in my heart

Although you've gone away
I tell you my feelings never change
I'm missing you every night and day
And it's driving me crazy baby
My love for you remains
I'm tired of playing foolish games
I know that I'm the one to blame
And I miss you like crazy, baby

After we said goodbye
Baby I finally realized
That I just cannot walk away
'Cause this love for you still remains in my heart

After we said goodbye
Baby I finally realized
That I just cannot walk away
'Cause this love for you still remains in my heart

My heart, baby I miss you
I was a fool to let you walk away
I realize girl
After we said goodbye</p>
