I found that nothing in life is worthwhile. Unless you take risks
Nothing
Nelson Mandela said there is no passion to be found playing small
And settling for a life that’s less than the one you’re capable of living
I’m sure people have told you to make sure you have something to fall back on
Make sure you got something to fall back on, honey
But I never understood that concept having something to fall back on<!-- more -->
If I’m going to fall, I don’t want to fall back on anything
Except my faith. I want to fall forward. I figured at least this way I’ll see what I’m going to hit
Fall forward this is what I mean
Reggie Jackson struck out 26 hundred times in his career the most in the history of baseball
But you don’t hear about the strikeouts people remember the home runs
Fall forward
Thomas Edison conducted 1,000 failed experiments. Did you know that? I didn’t know that
Because the 1,001 was the light bulb
Fall forward
Every failed experiment is one step closer to success
You’ve got to take risks and I’m sure you’ve probably heard that before, but I want to talk to you about why that’s
so important
First
You will fail at some point in your life accept it you will lose you will embarrass yourself
You will suck at something. There’s no doubt about it
I’m telling you embrace it because it’s inevitable
And I should know
But here’s the thing
I didn’t quit
I didn’t fall back
I prayed
I prayed and I prayed
But I continued to fail and fail and fail
But it didn’t matter because you know what there’s an old saying
You hang around the barbershop long enough sooner or later you’re gonna get a haircut
So you will catch a break and I did catch a break
Here’s my second point about failure if you don’t fail you’re not even trying
I’ll say it again
if you don’t fail
You’re not even trying my wife told me this great expression. To get something. You never had. You have to do something you never did
Les Brown’s a motivational speaker. You made an analogy about this
He says imagine you’re on your deathbed and standing around your deathbed are the ghosts representing your unfulfilled
potential the ghosts of the ideas you never acted on the ghosts of the talents you didn’t use and they’re standing around your bed
angry
disappointed and upset
They say we came to you because you could have brought us to life they say
And now we have to go to the grave together. So I ask you today
How many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes
So you got to get out there. You got to give it everything you got whether it’s your time
Your talent, your prayers
or your treasures
What are you going to do with what you have? I’m not talking about how much you have
Some of you have money some of you have patience some of you have kindness some of you have loved
Some of you have the gift of long-suffering whatever it is, whatever your gift is
What are you going to do with what you have?
Alright now here’s my last point about failure
Sometimes it’s the best way to figure out where you’re going
Your life will never be a straight path
Because taking risk is not just about going for a job
It’s also about knowing what you know and what you don’t know. It’s about being open to people
and to ideas
To not only take risks
But to be open to life to accept new views and to be open to new opinions
Because the chances you take
The people you meet the people you love the faith that you have. That’s what’s going to define you
Never be discouraged
Never hold back
Give everything you’ve got
And when you fall throughout life
Remember this
Fall forward
